# Build a Multithreaded Application
Write a multithreaded application that simulates a producer-consumer scenario:
    
- Producers generate random numbers and add them to a shared queue.
- Consumers process numbers from the queue.
- Synchronize access to the queue.
- Ensure safe thread termination and resource cleanup.

**Evaluation Focus:** Use of threading constructs, handling concurrency issues, and optimizing for performance.
